              Progress on safety coincides with learning from failure. <span style="color:#b3e2cd;">This makes punishment
and learning two mutually exclusive activities: Organizations can either learn
from an accident or punish the individuals involved in it, but hardly do both
at the same time.</span> The reason is that punishment of individuals can protect
false beliefs about basically safe systems, where humans are the least reliable
components. Learning challenges and potentially changes the belief about what
creates safety. Moreover, <span style="color:#fbcdac;">punishment emphasizes that failures are deviant, that
  they do not naturally belong in the organization</span>...</blockquote>

                  When they create electronic devices, they can reflect on
                  whether that new product will take people away from themselves,
                  their family and nature. Instead they can create the kind of
                  devices and software that can help them go back to themselves, to
                  take care of their feelings. By doing that, they will feel good
                  because they’re doing something good for society.
